<p>Stuck on an assignment? Confused by the reading? Looking for feedback? Feeling disconnected or lonely? Need to clarify something you heard? These are all great reasons to join us on Slack and chat with your classmates or instructor. Our intent is for you to post questions, have conversations, give and receive support, and create a sense of community; but these are just some ideas. Make it your own!</p>

<p>This isn’t mandatory or part of your grade. You won’t be penalized for how you use (or don’t use) Slack. We just wanted to give you a tool to help in your learning experience. Since Slack is a tool that works on your computer, tablet, or phone, you have access any time you need it.</p>

<h3 id="start">Getting started is easy.</h3>

<h4 id="step-1-sign-up-with-your-slack-team">Step 1: Sign up with your Slack team</h4>
<p>An email invite was sent to the preferred address we have for you. Open that email and click “Join team,” then follow the prompts to enter your name, create a username and set your password.</p>

<p><img src="./07 Welcome email.png" width="1144" height="830" alt="07 Welcome email.png"></p>

<p>After you sign up, we recommend you download Slack’s apps for iOS, Android, Windows or Mac at <a href="https://slack.com/downloads">https://slack.com/downloads</a>.</p>

<p>You can find a link to your Slack team on the course home page, the syllabus, Module 1 Peer Introductions activity, or in the Announcements from your instructor.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-get-familiar-with-slack">Step 2: Get familiar with Slack</h4>
<p>A Slack community is called a team; your team includes the students and instructors in your section. Conversations are organized into channels (which are public), and direct messages (which are private). We go into more detail below.</p>

<p><em>Desktop users:</em> Channels and direct messages appear on the left.</p>

<p><img src="./08 Channels D.png" width="1144" height="576" alt="08 Channels D.png"></p>

<p><em>Mobile users:</em> Channels and direct messages appear behind the Slack icon.</p>

<p><img src="./09 Channels M.png" width="1144" height="576" alt="09 Channels M.png"></p>

<h4 id="step-3-say-hello-to-the-class">Step 3: Say hello to the class</h4>
<p>Find the #classroom channel (note that channels are named with hashtags #) and post something to help your class get to know you—what is something interesting about yourself? What are you looking forward to this term?</p>

<h3 id="faq">What can I do with Slack?</h3>

<p>Like we said before, conversations in Slack are organized into channels, which are public, and direct messages, which are private. Channels have a topic or theme, and there are a number of channels already set up (you can add more if you want):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>#classroom:</strong> for general course discussion</li>
  <li><strong>#assignment:</strong> for specific support regarding studying, coursework and upcoming items that are due</li>
  <li><strong>#off-topic:</strong> a free space to get to know your classmates and have non-classroom related discussions</li>
  <li><strong>#slack-help:</strong> for posting questions you have about how to use Slack</li>
  <li><strong>#feedback:</strong> for giving feedback about the Slack tool &amp; community. We review this to help improve the experience for future students.</li>
</ul>

<p id="channel"><strong>Chat in a channel</strong></p>

<p>Select the channel from the list and post your message. Channels are public and anyone who is in that channel can see what you post. You can see who is in a particular channel by clicking on the members under the channel name.</p>

<p><img src="./10 Channel members.png" width="445" height="219" alt="10 Channel members.png"></p>

<p id="direct"><strong>Direct message someone</strong></p>

<p>You can send a direct message to one or more people (up to eight). Direct messages are private and can only be seen by the people included in the message.</p>

<p><em>Desktop users:</em> click “Direct Messages” in the left column. Select one or more people from the list and click Go. Post your message.</p>

<p><img src="./11 Direct message step 1.png" width="1144" height="476" alt="11 Direct message step 1.png">
<img src="./11 Direct message step 2 D.png" width="1144" height="576" alt="11 Direct message step 2 D.png"></p>

<p><em>Mobile users:</em> open the menu by tapping the Slack icon, then tap the + icon next to Direct Messages. Select one or more people from the list and tap Start. Post your message.</p>

<p><img src="./12 Direct message M.png" width="1134" height="568" alt="12 Direct message M.png"></p>

<p id="mentions"><strong>Use @ mentions</strong></p>

<p>To get someone’s attention in a channel, <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205240127-Mention-a-team-member">mention</a> them by typing ‘@’ followed by their username, e.g. @jdoe. They’ll see a red badge on the channel and be notified via email or their mobile device if they’re not active in Slack.</p>

<p id="notifications"><strong>Control your notifications</strong></p>

<p>Under Preferences, you’ll find highly configurable <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201895138-Understanding-Slack-notifications">notifications</a> to make sure you see the important stuff as soon as you need to without being distracted by the rest.</p>

<p><img src="./03 Notifications1.png" width="572" height="221" alt="03 Notifications1.png"></p>

<p>You can also add a <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204092246-Edit-your-profile">profile photo or image</a>, <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201330736-Uploading-and-sharing-files">upload files</a> into a message (like a photo, a document, or a PDF), create <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203950418-Composing-a-Post">posts</a> and <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Creating-a-Snippet">snippets</a>, use <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202931348-Emoji-and-emoticons">emoji</a>, and more.

<h3 id="expectations">Expectations for Slack</h3>

<h4 id="membership-standards">Membership Standards</h4>

<ul>
  <li>We expect that everybody will act in friendship—that is, we are all dedicated to making the space comfortable and welcoming and supportive. We trust each other, affirm their concerns, respect their privacy, assume the other person is acting with the best intentions, and act sincerely and openly.</li>
  <li>When giving feedback, remember to keep it constructive. Honest feedback is great, but there is no need to be cruel and snarky to someone who is asking for help. On the opposite side of the spectrum, sugar-coating feedback in order to spare someone’s feelings is not necessarily constructive either. The goal is to be supportive, honest and thoughtful.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="general-rules">General Rules</h4>

<ul>
  <li>No hatred, bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, or racism.</li>
  <li>No NSFW images or links.</li>
  <li>Be respectful and do not screenshot conversations or private matters.</li>
</ul>
