          h4 Considerations for implementation
          p The purpose of an introductory email to students is to fill a communication gap between 1) program selection and course enrollment and/or 2) course enrollment and class start date. Emails can be created on a program level (from the department head), on a course level (from the faculty), or both.
          p Email content could include a welcome message from the dean, department head, or faculty, address frequently asked questions, provide a checklist of pre-start tasks, highlight an online or on-campus event, or include support contact details. Consider existing communication, student profile and needs (i.e., are they a working adult or undergrad?), and what information has already been provided to create an email for a class or program that contains relevant content and makes students feel connected to their online program.
          h4 Additional considerations
          p While these emails begin to fill the communication gap, phone calls or other kinds of support may also be appropriate, especially in the first year or two.

          h4 Institutional requirements
          p Our goal was to create a branded, engaging email for students that would welcome them, positively reinforce their decision to study online, and get them excited about and prepared for their first week of classes. To do so, we created a template that can be branded for various institutions and is modular, allowing customization of content.
          p Key content includes a welcome from faculty, a review of pre-class requirements, highlights about the institution, and additional support information.
